        Like Mahatma Gandhi, African leader Nelson Mandela battled against the oppression of the South African people by whites. He received a legal lawyer education. However, he joined the African National Congress and dedicated himself to the goal of achieving equality among all Africans—white and black—by fighting against the policy of apartheid, or the segregation of the black native Africans from all positions of power and privilege. Instead of living comfortably and in luxury as a successful lawyer, he did the opposite. Mandela was sentenced to life in jail by the reactionary South African government in 1962.
        
        Mandela was finally released from jail on February 11, 1990, after 27 years and 9 months of imprisonment, as a result of other African National Congress leaders' ongoing fight for freedom. Nelson Mandela became the first black African to hold the office of President of the Republic of South Africa when the African National Congress won the general election on the basis of the universal adult franchise that had been implemented by the administration of President F.D.H. Clarke.
        
        Mandela's greatness stems not only from his success in convincing the white South African government to abolish the hateful and inhuman apartheid, but also from his inspiring call to blacks not to seek vengeance on whites for past acts of tyranny, injustice, and exploitation.
